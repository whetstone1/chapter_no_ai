The Chapter without AI functionalities 

In a Nutshell: Subscribe to a Classic book with your friends.

What we do: 

The Chapter re-serializes Classic novels; divides each book by chapter and sends each chapter out as an installment in a regular email newsletter (either to individuals or groups of readers), charging a monthly subscription fee per book. Users can change either the chunk of book they get at one time (e.g. 1 chapter, 2 chapters), or they can update how quickly the newsletter comes to them. 

Background: 

Nearly all the great Classic novels -- War and Peace, Moby Dick, Les Miserables, Middlemarch -- were published serially. The stories were meant to be "lived in" over months and years, not binged in days or weeks. This way of reading them historically proves much more compelling and manageable for readers, and much more profitable for publishers. 

In other words, we want the Chapter release to how TV used to be -- a family or group of friends gathering every week as a social ritual for the release of the newest episode of their favorite show. In essence, we want to bring the pacing of peak TV to the greatest stories of all time.
